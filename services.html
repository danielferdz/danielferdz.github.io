      <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('keyholdingcontent')"><h3 class="servicetitle">Key holding only</h3></a>
        <div id="keyholdingcontent" style="display:none;"><p>For our clients who do not regularly rent their property we can securely hold a set of keys to your property. If you have maintenance or renovations we can meet the relevant tradesperson at your property to provide access at an extra cost.</p></div>

      <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('keyholdingandmonthlycheckscontent')"><h3 class="servicetitle">Key holding and monthly checks</h3></a>
        <div id="keyholdingandmonthlycheckscontent" style="display:none;"><p>In addition to the above service we check your property two times a month. Doors and windows are opened and persiana blinds, where installed, are checked for function. Observations for security compromise, water damage, mold, leaks and damage are made and reported back to the owner as necessary. Water, gas and electricity supplies are checked. Toilets are flushed and drains refreshed during periods of non-occupancy. Any problems are reported back to the owner with supporting photographs if necessary.</p></div>

      <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('cleaningcontent')"><h3 class="servicetitle">Cleaning</h3></a><div id="cleaningcontent" style="display:none;"><p>The prices for standard 2 and 3 bedroom apartments with main bathroom, shower room and small terrace are detailed in the grid below. Properties with more than 1 terrace, patio or solariums are priced individually. Please ask for further details.</p>

      <p>Our bed linen is professionally laundered at a commercial launderette in Los Alcazares. When we collect our laundry it is sealed in plastic bags from the launderette and this seal will remain intact until the linen is required for a changeover. Towels will be washed in your washing machine with our laundry cleaner. Bulky items that cannot be washed will be taken and professionally laundered. It is requested that all apartments have at least 2 full sets of bed linen for each bed. In the warmer summer season when quilts are too warm we suggest using a throw or lightweight bedspread.</p>

      <p>Mattress and pillow protectors, bedspreads, quilts, table cloths, rugs, decorative cushions, sofa throws and blankets can be professionally laundered at additional cost. Please ask for details.</p>

      <p>Our standard cleans after guests have vacated your property include the following:</p>

        <li>Polish indoor furniture, vacuum rugs, sweep and mop tiled floors.</li>
        <li>Windows will be cleaned for visible marks, such as handprints, splashes. Although full window cleans inside and out incur additional charges.</li>

      <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('deepcleanscontent')"><h3 class="servicetitle">Deep cleans</h3></a><div id="deepcleanscontent" style="display:none;"><p>After periods of non-occupancy apartments and villas can accumulate significant dirt. Deep cleans take considerably longer and therefore involve additional charges. Sofas, beds and furniture will be moved to clean underneath, rodapies, architraves, doors, windows, inside wardrobes and cupboards will be cleaned as well as patios and terraces, including outside furniture, swept, mopped and cleaned. Deep cleans are highly recommended at the beginning of the summer season and are charged for on an individual basis dependent upon time taken and the size of the property. We would be pleased to confirm a quote in advance of this service.</p></div>

      <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('meetandgreetcontent')"><h3 class="servicetitle">Meet and greet</h3></a><div id="meetandgreetcontent" style="display:none;"><p>We offer a meet and greet service to all our guests. Owners must provide guest email details to us, ideally at least 7 days prior to arrival. We will contact the guest by email to confirm flight arrival details and means of transport to the property. We request that guests contact us immediately prior to their departure from their arrival airport. Whereby car hire is arranged the guests follow us to the property in their vehicle. When using a taxi from the airport, we will wait at a specifically agreed meeting point whereby the guests REMAIN in the taxi and follow us to the apartment in the taxi.</p>

Door locks and security measures will be discussed, 1 set of keys are handed over and the cleaning and meet and greet fee (where the guests pays the meet and greet fee) collected at the same time.</p>

      <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('airconmeterscontent')"><h3 class="servicetitle">Air conditioning meters</h3></a><div id="airconmeterscontent" style="display:none;"><p>Whilst the option of renting your property may prove financially advantageous, the costs of running air conditioning units for long periods of time do not! In conjunction with Air Menor, we are able to arrange meters to be connected to your air-conditioning units to encourage guests to use this facility more economically. Guests are given a card with a nominal amount of credit for their stay, eg, €5 - €10 euros. The meter is set at a higher rate per unit than the property owner is charged by their supplier, therefore encouraging guests to turn off air-con units when the property is vacant, thus promoting cost efficient usage. Prices available upon application, please ask for details.</p></div>

      <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('maintenancecontent')"><h3 class="servicetitle">Maintenance, renovations and repairs</h3></a><div id="maintenancecontent" style="display:none;"><p>We liaise with reputable local tradespeople to provide additional services. If you would like improvements made to your property or need maintenance, we would be pleased to provide quotes and arrange this for you. From locksmiths, to plumbers, carpenters, boiler engineers and general DIY, we can accommodate most requirements – please don’t hesitate to ask.</p></div>
